Factorials, "n choose k", fast exponentiation algorithms, modular arithmetic, probability, vectors, and linked lists

This is for testing and using various algorithms for various functions such as factorials and fast exponentiation.  It's basically a playground for practicing various ideas that I learned in discrete math.  Right now it doesn't have a lot in it, and it's only a single source file.
